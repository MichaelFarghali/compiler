\section*{Introduction}
This is a preliminary Software Design Document (SSD) for my mini-Pascal complier that I will be working on over the next two semesters. When completed it should accept a text file which represents a mini pascal language. The text file should then be able to be converted to assembly language if its syntax is correct according to our production rules. 
\section*{Scanner}
The Scanner class should read in a file and process it character by character. It is based on a Deterministic Finite Automata, Appendix A, and the given grammars. The Scanner reads in a file and attempts to match each string to a given keyword, symbol, or number. It returns a valid Token if the string is valid in the language or it will return false. See Appendix B for list of valid Tokens.

\section*{Parser}
The Parser class processes a text file token by token which are given by the Scanner class. It uses the grammar rules listed in Appendix C to match the tokens against expected tokens. It will eventually create a parse tree but for now it only checks that the production rules are followed.
