\section{Introduction}
This is a preliminary Software Design Document (SSD) for my mini-Pascal complier that I will be working on over the next two semesters. 
\end{Introduction}
\section{Scanner}
The Scanner Class should read in a file and process it character by character. It is based on a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and the given grammars. The Scanner reads in a file and attempts to match each string to a given keyword, symbol, or number. 
I've chosen to keep all the work in one method, (Scanner.nextToken() ), for now but intend to modularize it in the future.
